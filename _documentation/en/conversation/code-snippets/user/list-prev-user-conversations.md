# List Previous Page of a User's Conversations

In this code snippet you learn how to get the previous page of Conversations a User is associated with.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`USER_ID` | The unique ID of the User.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/user/list-prev-user-conversations'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application containing at least one Conversation and one User in order to see a list of a User's Conversations. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and a Conversation. See also the Create User code snippet on how to create a User.
```

## Try it out

When you run the code you will get the previous page of Conversations associated with the specified User.
