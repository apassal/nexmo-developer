# Release Notes

## 1.2.0 - 2019-12-03

### Added
`NXMClient`'s `getConversationsPageWithSize:order:completionHandler:` method to get conversations with paging.

`NXMConversationsPage`, which represents the retrieved page, provides the following instance methods

- `hasNextPage` / `hasPreviousPage` to check if forward/backward page retrieval is possible and
- `nextPage:` / `previousPage:` to asynchronously retrieve the next/previous page.

### Changed
`NXMClient`'s `getConversationWithUUid:completionHandler:` method's name typo (now called `getConversationWithUuid:completionHandler:`).

---

## 1.1.1 - 2019-11-21

### Added

`NXMClientConfig` object in order to change data center configuration. How to use:

```
[NXMClient setConfiguration:NXMClientConfig.DC]
```

`NXMClient setConfiguration` is optional, configuration will set to a default value.
Note: you most call `setConfiguration` method before using `NXMClient.shared`.

---

## 1.1.0 - 2019-11-14

### Fixed

- iOS 13 push notifications support
- Start server call stability
- Receiving a DTMF event in call and conversation

### Added

`NXMConversationDelegate` did receive DTMF event method:

```
- (void)conversation:(nonnull NXMConversation *)conversation didReceiveDTMFEvent:(nullable NXMDTMFEvent *)event;
```

### Changed

`NXMClient` - client enable push notifications method changed.
`param pushKitToken` - only for VoIP push (incoming calls).
`param userNotificationToken` - all push types:

```
- (void)enablePushNotificationsWithPushKitToken:(nullable NSData *)pushKitToken
                          userNotificationToken:(nullable NSData *)userNotificationToken
                                      isSandbox:(BOOL)isSandbox
                              completionHandler:(void(^_Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable error))completionHandler;
```

## Version 1.0.0 - 2019-09-05

### Fixed

- `NexmoClient` when disconnected returns error callback for all function.
- `CallMember` status calculated by the current leg status.
- `CallMember` supports failed, busy, timeout and canceled statuses.
- Supports member invited.
- `Conversation` has media methods.
- `NexmoClient` is now singleton.
- Call method changed to string instead of array.
- `NexmoClient` delegate methods renamed.

### Added

- Added conversation media:

```objective-c
NXMConversation myConversation;
[myConversation enableMedia];   // my media will be enabled
[myConversation disableMedia];  // my media will be disabled
```
​
Added invite member:

```objective-c
NXMConversation myConversation;
[myConversation inviteMemberWithUsername:@"someUsername"
                      completion:myCompletionBlock];
```
​
- Added the member state initiator:

```objective-c
NXMMember *member = someMember;
NSDictionary<NSValue *, NXMInitiator *> *initiators = member.initiators; 
​
NXMInitiator leftStateInitiator = initiators[NXMMemberStateLeft];
leftStateInitiator.isSystem;
leftStateInitiator.userId;
leftStateInitiator.memberId;
leftStateInitiator.time;
```

Added `NXMConversationUpdateDelegate` to notify on member updates like media,leg, and state.
Added `updatesDelegate` property to `NXMConversation`:

```objective-c
@property (nonatomic, weak, nullable) id <NXMConversationUpdateDelegate> updatesDelegate;
```

Example:

```objective-c
@interface MyClass() <NXMConversationUpdateDelegate>
@implementation MyClass
​
- (void)setConversation:(NXMConversation *conversation) {
	conversation.updatesDelegate(self); // register to conversation updatesDelegate
}
​
- (void)conversation:(nonnull NXMConversation *)conversation didUpdateMember:(nonnull NXMMember *)member withType:(NXMMemberUpdateType)type {
	if (type == NXMMemberUpdateTypeState) {
		// the member state changed
	}
​
	if (type == NXMMemberUpdateTypeMedia) {
		// the member media changed
	}
}
@end
```
​
### Changed
​
- `NXMClient` is now a singleton:

```objective-c
NXMClient.shared // the shared instance of NXMClient

​
// was - (void)login;
