If you are planning to use JavaScript to develop your application, you'll need to install (or update) the latest version of the Nexmo Client SDK.

Create a new project directory and change into it. Then run the following command:

``` bash
$ npm init
$ npm install nexmo-client --save
```

This will install the Client SDK into the `node_modules` directory within your project folder.

If you already have the Client SDK installed the above command will upgrade your Client SDK to the latest version.
