You must make your webhook accessible to Nexmoâ€™s APIs over the public Internet. An easy way to achieve this during development without standing up your own server is to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). To learn more, [read our blog post on ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr).

Download and install ngrok, then execute the following command to expose your application on port 3000 to the public Internet:

``` shell
./ngrok http 3000
```

If you are a paid subscriber you could type:

``` shell
./ngrok http 3000 -subdomain=your_domain
```

> **NOTE:** In this example Ngrok will divert the Nexmo webhooks you specified when you created your Nexmo application to `localhost:3000`. Although port 3000 is shown here, you can use any free port that is convenient.
