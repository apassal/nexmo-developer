# Create a client side application

Create an HTML file called `index.html` in your project directory. Add the following code, but make sure you paste the JWT you generated for the user in the [earlier step](/client-sdk/tutorials/app-to-phone/client-sdk/generate-jwt) in this tutorial in to the `USER_JWT` constant:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <script src="nexmoClient.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

  <form id="call-phone-form">
    <h1>Call Phone from App</h1>
    <input type="text" name="phonenumber" value="">
    <input type="submit" value="Call" />
  </form>

  <script>
    const USER_JWT = "PASTE YOUR JWT HERE";
    const callPhoneForm = document.getElementById("call-phone-form");
    new NexmoClient({ debug: true })
      .login(USER_JWT)
      .then(app => {
        callPhoneForm.addEventListener("submit", event => {
          event.preventDefault();
          let number = callPhoneForm.children.phonenumber.value;
          app.callServer(number);
        });
      })
      .catch(console.error);
  </script>

</body>

</html>
```

This is your web application that uses the Client SDK to make a voice call to the destination phone via Nexmo.

There are several key components to this code:

1. A simple UI that allows you to enter a phone number and then click the `Call` button to make the voice call.
2. Code that logs the user in (a JWT is used for authentication).
3. The function to make the call `callServer(number)`, where `number` is the destination phone number in [E.164](/concepts/guides/glossary#e-164-format) format.

Once you enter the phone number and click the `Call` button you will hear a voice reporting on call status. Then when the call goes through you can answer and you will then hear the conversation via the app.
